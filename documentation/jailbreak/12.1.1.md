### Using Uncover's Jailbreak

Using [Cydia Impactor](http://www.cydiaimpactor.com/),
1. Select Device->Install Package from the top menu.
2. Select the latest uncover jailbreak .ipa file downloaded from [unc0ver's releases](https://github.com/pwn20wndstuff/Undecimus/releases)
3. Enter your apple ID, and generate an app specific password to use [here](appleid.apple.com).

Cydia impactor at this point should load unc0ver onto your device.

Jailbreaking your device:
1. On your device, launch the new unc0ver app you just loaded in the previous step
2. Press Jailbreak

This will cause your device to begin the jailbreaking process.
Repeat the previous 2 steps until the app states your device is jailbroken, and
when you open the app, it provides an option to 'Re-jailbreak', rather than 'Jailbreak'

Once your device is jailbroken, Cydia App store will work.

NOTES:
- If your device is restarted you will have to re-jailbreak. To do this, restart the unc0ver app and follow the above directions.
- My App specific password:
    - whxs-klpt-jius-nito
- Apps you install will need to be re-signed every 7. To do this painlessly, install [ReProvision](https://github.com/Matchstic/ReProvision)
